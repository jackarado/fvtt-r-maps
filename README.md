# FVTT R-Maps

This is a tool to help you make r-maps, a.k.a. relationship maps, Anacapa
charts, conspiracy maps, in your Foundry VTT game.

Place tokens, draw lines between them, and have those lines automatically
update as you move the tokens around.

## TODO

 - [ ] TODO: permissions stuff is weird? Users are having perms errors in the
   console, but it all seems to be working anyway. Not a comforting situation.
   See https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/permissions
 - [ ] TODO: write unit tests. [Quench](https://github.com/Ethaks/FVTT-Quench)?
 - [ ] These might be handled by Advanced Drawing Tools:
   - [ ] TODO: add labels on edges.
   - [ ] TODO: colour and style.
   - [ ] TODO: support adding intermediate control points and getting bezier-y?
   - [ ] TODO: add endcap arrows.
